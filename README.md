2. **Sub-Category Trends**: Within each category, certain sub-categories dominate. For example, in Data Science, Machine Learning and AI courses receive the most enrollments.

3. **Language Preferences**: English is the dominant language for most courses, but other languages show potential for expansion based on user preferences.

4. **Viewership Patterns**: Peak enrollments occur in specific months, possibly aligning with academic or corporate training cycles.

5. **Course Format Popularity**: Specialization programs tend to have higher engagement compared to standalone courses, suggesting that learners prefer structured learning paths.

6. **Average Number of Viewers per Sub-Category**: Some sub-categories, such as Electrical Engineering, attract more viewers, highlighting areas of high learner interest.

7. **Instructor Performance**: Highly-rated instructors tend to attract more enrollments, indicating that instructor credibility plays a crucial role in learner engagement.

8. **Rating Distribution**: Most courses have an **average rating above 4.0**, indicating high learner satisfaction. However, identifying courses with lower ratings can help improve content quality.
